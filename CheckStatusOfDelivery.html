Check Status of Delivery

    <h1>Check Status of Delivery
    </h1>

If the order could be late, please do the following:
<br>
1. Check the expected delivery date and have the customer check the status of the order in Your Account <br>
2. If there is a tracking number for the delivery, help the customer locate it in the Order History tab <br>
3. Check to see if the customer has received any emails or SMS messages about the order <br>

Our tracking code starts working in the morning, after we've shipped an order. If a customer hasn't added a phone number to receive SMS, but would like to do so, have them go to Account Settings and check the box 'Upon shipping, SMS' at the bottom left-hand side of the page. <br>

Tracking codes are only available for orders placed with certain shipping methods -please see the Delivery Time page. If an order was not shipped with express, please be aware that the delivery time can be 1-3 working days later than the estimated delivery time you see in the system. This is due to local postal service variations. <br>
